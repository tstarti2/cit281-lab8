# Lab 8: Working with Node.js and Fetch API

Throughout this lab, I focused on utilizing Node.js and the Fetch API to interact with external APIs and handle asynchronous operations. Here's an overview of what I accomplished:

## Overview

The lab aimed to provide practical experience in initializing a Node.js project, installing necessary packages, setting up a basic server with Fastify, and fetching data from a remote API using the Fetch API.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Creating Lab File and Initializing Node.js Folder:** I created a new file for the lab and initialized the folder as a Node.js project to manage dependencies efficiently.
- **Installing node-fetch Package:** I installed the `node-fetch` package using npm to enable fetch API functionality in Node.js, allowing me to fetch data from external APIs.
- **Adding Fastify Starter Code:** I set up a basic Fastify server in the lab file to handle HTTP requests and responses, providing a foundation for fetching data from external APIs.
- **Requiring Fastify and node-fetch Modules:** I required the Fastify and `node-fetch` modules at the top of the lab file to utilize their functionalities within my code.
- **Fetching JSONPlaceholder Data:** I used the Fetch API to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API, such as posts or users, and logged the results to the console, demonstrating my ability to interact with external APIs.

## Lab Structure

Throughout the lab, I followed a structured series of steps that allowed me to:
- Create a dedicated lab file and initialize the folder as a Node.js project.
- Install the `node-fetch` package to enable fetch API functionality in Node.js.
- Set up a basic Fastify server to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Require the Fastify and `node-fetch` modules to utilize their functionalities.
- Fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API using the Fetch API and log the results.

By completing this lab, I gained valuable experience in working with Node.js, installing and managing packages, setting up a basic server with Fastify, and fetching data from external APIs using the Fetch API.
