# Lab 8: Working with Node.js and Fetch API

## Overview

This lab focuses on utilizing Node.js and the Fetch API to interact with external APIs and handle asynchronous operations. You will initialize a Node.js project, install necessary packages, and fetch data from a remote API using the Fetch API.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Create a lab file and initialize a Node.js folder**
- **Install the node-fetch package to enable fetch API functionality**
- **Add Fastify starter code to set up a basic server**
- **Require the Fastify and node-fetch modules in the lab file**
- **Fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API using the Fetch API**

## Lab Structure

### Part 1: Create Lab File and Initialize Node.js Folder

- Create a new file for the lab and initialize the folder as a Node.js project to manage dependencies.

### Part 2: Install node-fetch Package

- Install the `node-fetch` package using npm to enable fetch API functionality in Node.js.

### Part 3: Add Fastify Starter Code

- Set up a basic Fastify server in the lab file to handle HTTP requests and responses.

### Part 4: Add Fastify and node-fetch Require Statements

- Require the Fastify and `node-fetch` modules at the top of the lab file to utilize their functionalities.

### Part 5: Fetch JSONPlaceholder Data

- Use the Fetch API to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API, such as posts or users, and log the results.

By completing this lab, you will gain practical experience in working with Node.js, installing and managing packages, setting up a basic server with Fastify, and fetching data from external APIs using the Fetch API.
